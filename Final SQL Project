# For this project I downloaded a dataset called "chinook" from Kaggle. 
# It contains data from a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
# I utilized SQL to analyze the dataset, and crafted questions aimed at gaining insights for the digital media store.


#1. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT 
cust.FirstName, 
cust.LastName, 
inv.InvoiceId, 
inv.BillingCountry, 
inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust 
on inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";

#2. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#3. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#4. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.Tracks t 
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId;

#5. Find the total amount of each invoice, along with the customer's first and last names, their country, and the name of the sales agent associated with each invoice
SELECT 
    emp.LastName AS "Sales Agent Last Name",
    emp.Firstname AS "Sales Agent First Name",
    cust.FirstName AS "Customer First Name",
    cust.LastName AS "Customer Last Name",
    cust.Country AS "Customer Country",
    inv.total AS "Invoice Total"
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices inv ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#6. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM chinook.Employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent" ;

#7. Who was the first Sales Agent that was hired?
SELECT 
LastName,
FirstName,
HireDate,
FROM chinook.employees DESC
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent"
LIMIT 1;

#8. Which employees reside in Lethbridge? And what are their titles?
SELECT 
LastName,
FirstName, 
City, 
Title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE City = "Lethbridge";
